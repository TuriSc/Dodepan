## Dodepan enclosure 3D models

This folder contains the STL and OpenScad files for the enclosure of Dodepan.

### PCB version

You only need to print:
- Enclosure_PCB
- Lid
- Encoder knob

### Handwired version

You might have to create two or more standoffs to support your speaker.
You also need to print:
- 2x OLED bracket
- 3x Standoff peg (or more if you need them for your speaker)

### Optional print settings

- Fill pattern: Honeycomb
- Fill angle: 30
- Bridging angle: 180

With some filaments the knob might have to be printed at 101% or 99% of its original size due to the filament's tendency to shrink or expand during the printing process.

I printed my lid upside down, to give it a smooth finish and a nice effect on the hexagons. Remember to set the bridging angle to a specified value.
