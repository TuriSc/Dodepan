1. Solder the MAX98357 module using its headers. Do not solder the speaker terminal to the module. Solder the two speaker output pins to the PCB
1. Solder the speaker terminal to the PCB
1. Solder the R1 resistor for MAX98357

1. Solder the GY-521 module to the PCB using its headers. Make sure it's perfectly aligned as it must be located at the center of movement of the enclosure
![GY-521](images/GY-521.jpg)
1. Solder the external I²C pullup resistors R2 and R3. Please note that the old version of the PCB used in these pictures does not include the two resistors

1. Solder the MPR121 module to the PCB using its headers
![MPR121](images/MPR121.jpg)
1. Solder the jack socket
1. Solder the power switch wires so that they come out of the back side of the PCB. Do not solder them to the switch yet
![power switch wires](images/power switch wires.jpg)
1. Solder the battery wires so that they come out of the back side of the PCB
![battery wires](images/battery wires.jpg)
1. Solder six short solid core wires on the PCB to serve as "headers" for the TP4056 module. Avoid rigid header pins
![TP4056 headers](images/TP4056 headers.jpg)
1. Place a thin strip of insulating tape through the four back headers you just soldered (B+, B-, Out+, Out-) and over the four pads underneath. This is needed because there are slightly different TP4056 modules on the market and the pads might not perfectly align. Do not solder the TP4056 yet

1. Solder the decoupling capacitor
1. Trim the short side of the OLED headers so they're almost flush with their board. Place the OLED into its slot on the enclosure
![OLED headers](images/OLED headers.jpg)
1. Place the rotary encoder on the back side of the PCB without soldering it. Remember to remove the washer and nut
1. Place the speaker inside the enclosure
1. Place the PCB in the enclosure, audio jack first, ensuring the rotary encoder and the OLED are in their correct position and the wires for the battery, the power switch, and the speaker are accessible. Bend the enclosure, not the PCB
![speaker and pcb](images/speaker and pcb.jpg)
1. Solder the OLED display to the PCB
1. Solder the rotary encoder to the PCB
1. Make sure the USB socket of the TP4056 module is fitting into its hole and solder the module to the PCB
![TP4056](images/TP4056.jpg)
1. Secure the PCB to the enclosure with the M2 screws
1. Place the power switch into its hole and solder its two wires to it
![switch](images/switch.jpg)
1. Place the battery springs into their sockets, bend their tabs outward, and solder them to their wires
![battery springs](images/battery springs.jpg)
1. Place the Pico so that the Micro-USB socket goes fully through the enclosure wall. Align it with the pads on the PCB and use some tape to secure it in position as you solder it
![Pico](images/Pico.jpg)
1. Solder the twelve drawing pins/electrodes. If you painted the pins, be very quick as heat softens the enamel
![pins](images/pins.jpg)
1. Lock the speaker wires into the audio output terminal. Use some hot glue to secure the speaker in place 
1. Install the washer, nut, and knob on the rotary encoder
1. Install the battery
![battery](images/battery.jpg)
1. Flash the firmware on the Pico
1. Install the lid and secure it with the M2 screws# Dodepan step-by-step assembly guide (PCB version)
