# Dodepan (I2S, 16bit version)

Under development. Please use the [older repository](https://github.com/TuriSc/Dodepan) for now.

This is the firmware for a new iteration of the Dodepan musical instrument.
The hardware features:
- a larger flash chip, allowing noise-free 16bit samples to be used
- an I2S DAC rather than PWM for improved audio quality
- buttons to select key and scale rather than potentiometers
